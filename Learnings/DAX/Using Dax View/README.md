**ðŸ§ª DAX Query View: My Testing Ground for Scenario Flags**

This snapshot shows how I use `DEFINE` and `EVALUATE` to simulate logic before embedding it into visuals. Itâ€™s a modular, low-risk way to validate flags, thresholds, and edge-case behaviorâ€”especially when working with insurance or ITSM datasets.


In this exercise, I used DEFINE to create temporary measures and EVALUATE to simulate a filtered table. This allowed me to treat measures like variables and preview their behavior in a controlled environment.

For me, this saves a lot of headache than doing wild DAX and then getting lost in the process. 

My goal was to surface only the relevant fields:
- `Company Name` (non-blank)
    
- `Product Brand`
    
- `New Price` (a measure)
    
- `Flag/Status` based on a threshold
  
It's become my go-to strategy for testing scenarios.

Good Catch. We could remove second condition. ðŸ˜œ
