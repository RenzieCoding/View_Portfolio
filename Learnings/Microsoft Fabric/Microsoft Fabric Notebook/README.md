Learning Reference: [Module 2 - Transform data with a dataflow in Data Factory - Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-end-to-end-dataflow)

Overview

I recently explored Microsoft Fabric's data capabilities through a three-module learning path. This hands-on experience helped me get familiar with the interface and key components like pipelines, dataflows, and Lakehouse.

Coming from a Power BI development background, I was able to apply my knowledge of Power Query, especially in areas like:

-  Dynamic column transformation
-  Appending columns without breaking the schema
-  Avoiding duplicate columns that can disrupt the query logic

One thing I always strive for is making scenarios as close to real business use cases as possible, and this learning path supported that mindset. If you're aiming to bridge the gap between data engineering and BI, this module is worth exploring.

- Built a Data Pipeline using the NYC Taxi dataset 
- Ingested and organized data in preparation for transformation

In the source tab, we can select the source. I've chosen the NYC taxi trip.
